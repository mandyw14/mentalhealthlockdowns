# The Emotional Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdowns in Canadians: A Twitter Sentiment Analysis Study 

 

## Introduction 

In efforts to combat COVID-19, the Canadian government at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels placed drastic restrictions on the general population, which affected the daily routines of almost every Canadian. The level of restriction has fluctuated throughout the pandemic, with varying levels of policies put in place depending on the state of the virus, and each Canadian region experienced these restrictions differently. At the highest points of lockdown stringency, various routine activities such as going to the gym, travelling, and gathering with loved ones were restricted for Canadians. Many of these activities are deemed vital to social, physical, and mental functioning. Here, we wish to specifically describe the effects of the lockdowns on Canadians’ emotional response to the pandemic, as captured through the sentiment analysis of Canadian COVID-19-related tweets.  

Apart from more traditional methods of capturing feedback such as surveys and questionnaires, sentiment analysis is an emerging method of monitoring a population’s response to a given event. Modern sentiment analysis tools can reliably quantify the underlying meanings, tones, and even emotions present in a piece of short-form text (2). Social media platforms such as Twitter are novel avenues for the collection of text data that can be used for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis like this has become popular in recent years and has been used, for example, to capture public opinion on government policies, and to reliably predict the movement of stock market indicators (3,4). During the COVID-19 pandemic, sentiment analysis of social media posts has been utilized to gain insight into the experiences of different groups of people, for example, Lwin et al5 analyzed the sentiment of COVID-19-related tweets throughout the pandemic and found that Western countries experienced more variation in sentiment regarding the pandemic than Eastern countries. Storey and O’Leary6 used sentiment analysis to find that tweets regarding COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic were more informative in their content, whereas tweets later in the pandemic showed more emotional content. Twitter gave millions of people, including Canadians, a place to share their opinions and experiences regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, this platform is a rich source of data to capture public emotional responses to the waves of lockdown experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Here we present the results of a sentiment analysis of Canadian tweets separated by province, and also grouped by the first six waves of the pandemic. We used the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) stringency index as a primary data source. The OxCGRT is a project created by Oxford University that tracks and quantifies the changes in COVID-19 lockdown stringency worldwide (1). The OxCGRT has tracked lockdown strictness in over 180 countries and their regions since January 01, 2020, including each Canadian province and territory. The tracker calculates a daily stringency value based on government policy changes in 21 different categories. Researchers have already used the OxCGRT to study the unintended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment, economy, and mental health (7-10).  

In this study, we sought to understand the public emotional response to the pandemic lockdowns by examining the relationship between the emotional content of tweets and the OxCGRT stringency index for the ten Canadian provinces (British Columbia – BC, Alberta – AB, Saskatchewan – SK, Manitoba – MB, Ontario – ON, Quebec – QB, New Brunswick – NB, Nova Scotia – NS, Prince Edward Island – PEI, Newfoundland – NF). We examined six “waves” of the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzed the province-specific patterns of emotional responses. 

 

# Methods  

Procedure: For this study, we used three sets of secondary data that were either provided directly to us or existed (at the time of this publication) as open data for research purposes. The data consisted of the 1) Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) Stringency Index, 2) COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Sentiments and Emotions Attributes provided, and 3) the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group (CCODWG) for additional COVID-19 data on cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities.   

 

### Dataset 1: Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) Stringency Index 

In April 2020, the first version of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) was published (1). The tracker evaluates governmental responses to COVID-19 in a given region to quantify the stringency of pandemic lockdowns in that region. Data updates for the OxCGRT spanned from January 2020 to the end of 2022. Each stringency index score was computed from 21 policy indicators, categorized into five groups: containment and closure, economic, health system, vaccination, and miscellaneous policies, all of which are listed in Hale et al1. Each indicator is assigned a value that denotes how stringent the government’s response is toward the said policy. Each of these policy indicators had their score combined and standardized to produce the stringency index average for a location with a value of 0 to 100. Once vaccination mandates came into effect, values were calculated separately for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and weighted values were created that reflected the percentage of the population that was vaccinated or not.    

 

### Dataset 2: COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Sentiments and Emotions Attributes  

CrystalFeel is a validated text-based sentiment analysis tool created by Yingpin Yang and colleagues at the A*STAR Institute of High-Performance Computing in Singapore. Multiple research groups have already used CrystalFeel for COVID-19 sentiment-related research (e.g., 12-15). The tool has been trained to detect the underlying emotions present in short-form text. When a user feeds the CrystalFeel API a piece of text, the algorithm calculates a score for five different emotions present in that text: the level of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear each ranging from zero to one. The higher the score for a given emotion, the more dominant that emotion is in the given piece of text. A “valence” statistic is calculated for a given piece of text as well. Valence denotes if the given piece of text contains a positive, negative, or neutral message; higher scores of valence denote a more positive message, lower scores of valence denote a more negative message, and middle-ranged scores denote a neutral message. In September 2020, the CrystalFeel group published the COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Latent Topics, Sentiments and Emotions Attributes, a repository of tweets about COVID-19 that have been sentimentally analyzed using CrystalFeel (16). They have since analyzed over 198 million tweets. Their dataset contains tweets published from early-2020 to mid-2022 that contained the hashtags #wuhan, #nCov, #corona, and #covid. Our colleagues at CrystalFeel have provided us access to a version of this dataset specific to Canadian-based COVID-19 tweets (see Table 1). This master dataset contains nine million Canadian tweets that have been analyzed using CrystalFeel. This dataset additionally contains the relative location of each given tweet, which is crucial for our analysis. An example of the dataset can be seen in Table 2.

### Dataset 3: COVID-19 Data: Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths  

The COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group (CCODWG) is an open-source COVID-19 data repository from the University of Toronto (17). The project has compiled much of the official COVID-19 reporting data from the different provinces and territories during the pandemic. Using the CCODWG API, one can access the reported cases, deaths, hospitalizations, ICU administrations, and vaccine statistics for Canada and its regions. Multiple teams have already CCODWG in their Canadian-based COVID-19 research (18,19).   

  

COVID-19 Wave Grouping: During the COVID-19 pandemic, different periods characterized by significant increases and decreases in cases have been referred to as "waves" typically associated with rising cases and the dominant virus strain. Although there are no official wave dates in Canada, six waves are generally recognized by the end of 2022. In this study, we grouped the six waves according to specific dates. The first wave occurred from February 1, 2020, until July 17, 2020. The second wave spanned from July 18, 2020, to March 4, 2021. The third wave started on March 5, 2021, and ended on July 22, 2021. The fourth pandemic wave lasted from July 23, 2021, until November 4, 2021. The fifth wave ran from November 5, 2021, to February 28, 2022. The sixth and final wave, up until our study deadline spanned from March 1, 2022, until June 2, 2022. These periods represent the peak case numbers and the lowest cases before another increase. 

  

Tweet Grouping: We used Python and the Pandas module to analyze the master dataset provided by the CrystalFeel team, creating ten data frames for each Canadian province of interest. The three Canadian territories were excluded due to insufficient data (i.e., too few tweets per day from those regions). We filtered tweets based on keywords related to each province and created an average emotion score for tweets published on the same day. Each data frame was then converted into an Excel file and modified to include only relevant information. Dates with fewer than ten tweets were excluded for each province to avoid skewed results. The total number of tweets obtained for each wave per province is shown in Table 3.

Data Analysis: We used a custom Python script (Python version 3.10) with Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy modules to analyze the data. Pearson correlations were conducted between stringency index and each emotion (Fear, Anger, Sadness, Happiness, and Valence) for each province and wave, with an alpha level set at p < 0.05. We also conducted regression analyses (OLS) with Valence as the dependent variable and four independent variables (OxCGRT lockdown stringency and changes in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) for each province to allow to determine which COVID-19 variable explained the most variability in the Valence variable for each province. We focused on the T values associated with the beta coefficients and their statistical significance as a measure of each variable’s unique contribution in predicting Valence. 

 

# Results 

Figure 1 shows the changes in daily tweet sentiment values (for each of the emotions of fear, anger, sadness, happiness, and emotional valence) from February 2020 until June 2022 along with the corresponding daily Stringency values for each Canadian province.

Table 4 shows the corresponding pearson correlation coefficients between the stringency values and each tweet emotion, for each of the six waves of the pandemic and each province. In the first wave of the pandemic, the correlations between each tweet emotion and stringency were very strong, with statistically significant correlations as high as .91 and never lower than .26. All but three of the 50 correlations were statistically significant (p < 0.05) during wave 1. For correlations that were statistically significant, fear, anger, and sadness were all negatively correlated with stringency, whereas happiness was positively correlated in all provinces, with the exception of Nova Scotia where happiness was negatively correlated. In all provinces, valence was positively correlated (p. < 0.05) with stringency during wave 1.

As seen in the correlation table, the correlations between stringency and each tweet emotion were significantly lower in subsequent waves of the pandemic. For example, correlation coefficients were never higher than .58 and rarely higher than .40.  

For subsequent waves of the pandemic (waves 2 – 6), in general correlations were lower and so was valence. In addition, two trends emerged. The first is that the wave-1 trend in which stringency was negatively correlated with fear, anger, and sadness and positively correlated with happiness and/or valence generally persisted for Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island. The second observation was that a reversed relationship emerged in which stringency was positively correlated with fear, anger, and sadness and negatively correlated with happiness and/or valence in British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. 

The results of our regression analyses for wave 1 are presented in Table 5a and subsequent waves are presented in Table 5b. The results of the regression analysis for wave 1 show that in every province stringency was the strongest, and often the only, significant predictor of valance. In some provinces (BC, SK, ON, NS), other COVID-19 variables were also significant predictors of valence in wave 1 but the T value for stringency was always greater.

In order to reduce the number of regression analyses conducted, we only conducted regression analyses on waves 2 through 6 when a statistically significant correlation was observed between stringency and valence. The analyses of these results show that in subsequent waves of the pandemic, stringency was not as strong of a predictor of valence as it was during wave 1 for all provinces. However, in Alberta, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, stringency continued to account for the variability in valence (p < 0.05) to a greater extent than other COVID-19 variables of vases, hospitalizations, or deaths. In contrast, in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, stringency no longer accounted for the most amount of variability in valence, (p > 0.05). In all of those provinces, with the exception of Quebec, COVID-19 Cases was the greatest predictor of valence. In Quebec, Deaths was the greatest predictor of valence.  

 

# Discussion 

Our Twitter analysis of the relationship between lockdown stringency and Canadian emotional sentiment towards the pandemic produced compelling findings in that wave 1 emotions were consistently represented across the provinces but, in subsequent waves, significant differences in emotional responses existed. In wave 1 of the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1, 2020 – July 17, 2020) nearly every sentiment for each province was significantly correlated with lockdown stringency in a consistent manner. Specifically, in wave 1 there was a significant positive correlation between lockdown stringency and happiness (i.e., both increased), and a significant negative correlation existed between stringency and the aversive emotions (fear, anger, sadness decreased as stringency increased). The regression analysis (seen in Table 5a) shows that the emotional pattern (i.e., increased fear, anger, and sadness and decreased happiness) in wave 1 was best explained by changes in stringency, and not by other COVID-19 related variables (cases, deaths, and hospitalizations). These analyses suggest that Canadians in all provinces who tweeted about COVID-19 were tweeting with sentiments that reflected favorable responses during periods of increased government regulation in the early stages of COVID-19.  

This early expression of emotion via Twitter may relate to other reported emotional experiences. For example, according to a meta-analysis conducted early in the pandemic with over 600,000 participants, the prevalence of clinically-significant depressive symptoms was significantly lower in countries where governments implemented stringent policies promptly (20). The emotional response indicated in our study (e.g., reduced fear, anger, sadness and increased happiness) suggests that Canadians may have felt a similar sense of emotional relief as the result of increased lockdown measures. Knowing that the government was taking appropriate measures to combat COVID-19 may have diffused much of the growing concern about COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Canadians may have experienced relief in knowing that the government was taking serious measures to combat the spread of the virus.  

However, in subsequent wave of the pandemic, the emotional responses detected with Twitter varied across provinces and wave. Some provinces, such as Alberta (wave 2 and 6), Quebec (wave 2), Manitoba (wave 5), and Prince Edward Island (wave 4 and 6) continued to show the same positive emotion pattern observed in wave 1 (i.e., stringency was negatively correlated with fear, sadness, and anger and positively correlated with happiness). This may represent a persistent sense of relief or a satisfaction when the public health measures and a concern when they were not. In contrast, other provinces, such as British Columbia (wave 5), Saskatchewan (wave 4), and Ontario (waves 3 and 5), showed a reversal effect in correlations. Stringency was negatively correlated with happiness and positively correlated with fear, anger, and sadness. This shows that people tweeting in those provinces were expressing the opposite emotions compared to those expressed early phases of the pandemic, as the pandemic and the stringent lockdowns continued.  

This switch in emotional expression may be accounted for by many factors. In this study, we examined the contribution of COVID-19 variables only. Specifically, a regression analysis was conducted to explain the contributions of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, along with stringency, in predicting emotional valence in subsequent waves. The results of the regression analysis provided some insight into what may have been driving the emotions expressed after wave 1. For example, in Alberta (waves 2 and 6), New Brunswick (wave 4), and Prince Edward Island (wave 4), stringency continued to be the primary predictor of the emotional valence. However, in other provinces such as Saskatchewan (wave 4), Manitoba (wave 5), Ontario (wave 3 and 5), and Nova Scotia (wave 3) cases was a greater predictor of emotional valence over and above stringency or the other COVID-19 variables. This may suggest that, regardless of the sentiment expressed in these provinces, the intensity of the sentiments (i.e., valance) was best predicted by cases even if it manifested differently. For example, in Manitoba, a persistent correlations from wave 1 as cases fluctuated may reflect ongoing support for the public health measures whereas in Ontario, the shift toward negative emotions may reflect a dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the measures as cases fluctuated. This point is worth further investigation because it may speak to the issue of how public health officials monitor and craft their messaging to ensure continued support by its constituents.  

Limitations: Our method and findings are notably limited in some ways. We were constrained in terms of the population of Canadians that we are collecting sentiments from. Not all Canadians use Twitter, in fact we were not able to use this method to gather public response in the three Canadian territories because there were too few tweets from those regions. Our data likely do not contain many responses from older and very young Canadian populations and other Canadians who do not use or have regular access to such technology. Our data is also constrained in terms of the conclusions we can draw from it. The results of this study specifically pertain to the Canadian emotional response to COVID-19 as a topic, and not Canadian emotional responses in general, as the Canadian tweets in our study specifically are hash-tagged in relation to COVID-19. The sentiments detected in non-COVID-19 tweets is also worth examining as it may reflect latent emotional responses from the broader population. However, we chose to focus on COVID-related tweets in order to manage the sheer volume of tweets on any given day.  

Our observed province-specific differences in emotional response also beg further investigation into what is triggering the varied emotional responses. It may be that differences in how provinces experienced the lockdowns is an important factor in driving regional-specific emotional responses. For example, the total time spent in the lockdowns or the fluctuations in and out of restrictions may be factors. To illustrate, consider Ontario, a province that suffered extensive and persistent restrictions, including stringency index values that went well over 80 after wave 1 and index values over 50 persisted well into wave 4. British Columbia, also had persistently high stringency values. On the other hand, Alberta experienced a drop in restrictions which resulted in a drop in index values near the 50 mark even within wave 1. Also, in Ontario, subsequent waves were much more stringent compared to the first, which is very different from any other province which all experienced reduced stringency after wave 1. Understanding the severity of each province’s restriction beyond daily values would be necessary to further investigate the impact of the lockdowns on the emotional responses of Canadians and possibly on many other factors affected by such unprecedented restrictions to people’s lives. Developing a metric to better capture the severity disparities over the entire course of the pandemic is a logical next step in evaluating the impact of the lockdowns in a province-specific manner, but is beyond the scope of this study.  

 It is also possible that specific restrictions may better explain the emotional experiences for waves past wave 1, such as differences in school closures, gym closures, or gatherings. During wave 1 there was a great deal of consistency across Canada in terms of provincial responses; however, the types of restrictions provinces imposed thereafter differed. Similarly, the specific and differing provincial government responses (e.g., the promptness of restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases) may also be a factor, or party demographics (e.g. majority vs. minority governments, the party in power, and/or changes in party leadership). Given all these and more possible factors, a more comprehensive analysis using Twitter sentiment analysis or other traditional methods of polling public response is warranted in order to understand the impact of the major lifestyle restrictions that Canadians experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience during future pandemics. Finally, a variety of economic, political, and a whole host of other demographic differences among the provinces may also explain why the changes in sentiments were observed in some provinces but not others as the pandemic continued. However, a full investigation of these factors is beyond the scope of this study, while also be a current limitation. 

## Conclusion 
Overall, our results indicate that drastic, population-level policy changes and restrictions imposed in the first wave of COVID-19 were met favorably and equally by Canadians across all provinces according to the sentiment analysis conducted in COVID-related tweets. However, after the initial wave, the positive emotional responses were weaker and, in some provinces, became negative. Few studies have assessed the impacts of COVID-19 public health measures on populations past the early phase of the pandemic; in studies that have, even fewer used the wave-based analysis that we employed. Our results are important because they show that varied regional emotional responses to the COVID-19 restrictions were detectable using Twitter throughout the pandemic and could be used in the future for ongoing and live monitoring of emotional responses to public health measures particularly during ongoing health emergencies.
